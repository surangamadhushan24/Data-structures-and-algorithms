Data Structures and Algorithms (Java)

This repository is a collection of classical data structures and algorithm implementations in Java. It's organized as small, focused examples and short programs intended for learning, practice, and reference.

## Contents

- `src/` — Java source code organized by topic (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, recursion).
  - Example entry points (classes with `main` methods) are provided to run and test each topic.

Top-level notable files and folders:

- `src/arrays/` — array utilities and demos (`Arrays.java`, `ArraysMain.java`).
- `src/linkedlist/` — simple singly-linked list implementation and demo (`LinkedList.java`, `LinkedListMain.java`).
- `src/stack/` — stack implementations and utilities (`Stack.java`, `StackMain.java`, `StringReverser.java`, `BalancedString.java`).
- `src/queues/` — queue implementations and helpers (`ArrayQueue.java`, `ReverseQueue.java`, `StackQueue.java`).
- `src/hashtable/` — hashtable examples (`HashTable.java`, `FirstNotRepeatedString.java`).
- `src/recursion/` — recursion examples (`Recursion.java`).
- `src/trees/binarytree/` — binary tree examples (`Tree.java`, `MainTreeB.java`).

## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or newer installed and `javac` / `java` available on your PATH.
- PowerShell (instructions below assume the default PowerShell on Windows). On other shells, adapt the commands accordingly.

## How to build

You can compile the whole `src` tree from the repository root. From PowerShell run:

```powershell
cd "d:\Data Structure\dsa\untitled"
javac -d out $(Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "*.java" -Path src | ForEach-Object { $_.FullName })
```

Explanation:
- `-d out` writes compiled classes into an `out` directory (created by `javac`).
- The `Get-ChildItem` pipeline expands all `.java` files under `src` so `javac` compiles all sources.

On non-PowerShell shells (bash, zsh) you can use a similar command:

```bash
mkdir -p out; javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")
```

## How to run examples

After compiling, run any example `main` by using its fully-qualified class name and pointing `java` to the `out` directory. Examples:

PowerShell examples:

```powershell
# Run the arrays demo
java -cp out arrays.ArraysMain

# Run the linked list demo
java -cp out linkedlist.LinkedListMain

# Run stack demo
java -cp out stack.StackMain

# Run binary tree demo
java -cp out trees.binarytree.MainTreeB
```

If you prefer to compile and run a single file quickly (useful during development):

```powershell
# Compile a single file
javac -d out src/stack/StackMain.java
# Run it
java -cp out stack.StackMain
```

## Project structure (short)

Each package in `src` contains classes relevant to one topic. Example `main` classes are placed alongside implementations and are simple runners or small demonstrations.

## Tests and verification

There are no automated tests included at the moment. To manually verify, compile and run the provided `*Main` classes as shown above.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your feature or fix.
3. Add/modify code and include a short example or test demonstrating behavior.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of the change.

Guidelines:

- Keep examples small and focused.
- Prefer clear variable names and short helper methods.
- Add comments where intent isn't obvious.

## License

This repository does not include a license file. If you intend to reuse or share the code publicly, consider adding an open-source license (for example, MIT or Apache-2.0). If you want, I can add a simple MIT license file for you.

## Notes

- If you'd like, I can add a Gradle or Maven build file to make building and running easier across platforms.
- I can also add a simple set of unit tests (JUnit) and a GitHub Actions workflow to run them on pushes.

If you'd like specific changes (a different tone, more examples, CI, or an actual license file added), tell me what you'd prefer and I'll update the README and optionally add supporting files.
